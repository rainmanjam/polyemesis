// These live on the destination and not in the composer because they are opaque
// ids an operator fetches once from Facebook's own console and then reuses --
// which Page to share with, which charity to collect for -- and because the
// create edge is the surface Meta documents. The Graph API reference has no
// Updating section for LiveVideo at all, so pushing them later would be building
// on an endpoint whose accepted parameters are written down nowhere.
